      <h3>System Analyst at Google</h3>
      <p>
        As a System Analyst, I analyzed business requirements and translated them into technical 
        specifications to support software development and system improvements. I collaborated 
        with cross-functional teams to design, test, and implement scalable solutions that 
        enhanced operational efficiency. I also maintained documentation, supported system 
        integration efforts, and ensured alignment with organizational goals and compliance 
        standards.

      <h3>Visual and Interaction Designer at Google</h3>
      <p>
        As a Visual and Interaction Designer, I created intuitive user interfaces and 
        engaging visual experiences by combining user-centered design principles with 
        brand consistency. I collaborated closely with UX researchers, developers, and 
        stakeholders to design wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity visuals that 
        enhanced usability and overall user satisfaction.
